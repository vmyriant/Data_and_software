The files are annotated based on the ligand names and the stage of simulation (.in and .out).

Ligands are:

NSC232005->232005
NSC20116 hydroxydiazenyl tautomer ->20116h
NSC20116 nitroso tautomer ->20116n

In docking grids, both grids with Asp469 protonated and neutral are available.

In FEP results, three seperate repeats of the same system simulation are available.

In MD results, three seperate repeats of each system are available.

In ab initio, the energies of gas and solution phase of 232005 are included in the 232005_tautomers.out files.
